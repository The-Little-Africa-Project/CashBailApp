                    <p class="text-white mb-4">Many people are being held in jail pretrial, meaning they have not yet
                        been convicted of a crime and are legally
                        presumed innocent. This is because our country largely has a system of money bail, in which the
                        constitutional principle
                        of “innocent until proven guilty” only really applies to the well off. With money bail, a
                        defendant is required to pay a
                        certain amount of money as a guarantee She/He will attend future court hearings. When She/He is
                        unable to come up with
                        the money, he can be incarcerated from her/his arrest until his case is resolved or dismissed in
                        court.</p>
